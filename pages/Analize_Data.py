1. Price Distribution:
   - Blue dots represent areas with lower prices (around 5k-10k per square foot).
   - Yellow to red dots represent areas with higher prices (up to 30k+ per square foot).
   - The darker red clusters suggest premium or high-demand areas.

2. Clustering:
   - Higher-priced properties (yellow/red) are concentrated in specific areas, indicating prime locations or upscale neighborhoods.
   - Lower-priced properties (blue) are more widespread, potentially in less developed or suburban areas.

3. Geographic Trends:
   - The central areas of Gurugram show a higher concentration of high-priced properties, suggesting better 
     infrastructure or proximity to commercial hubs. 
   - Outskirts, such as near Manesar, generally display lower price points.

4. Utility:
   - This map can help identify affordable vs. premium property zones.
   - Useful for analyzing location-based trends in property prices, assisting buyers, sellers, 
     or real estate developers.

1. FLATS :-
    * The price generally increases as the built-up area increases, which is an expected trend.
    * Most data points are concentrated in areas with smaller built-up areas (less than 4,000 sq ft) and lower prices.
    * Properties with more bedrooms (darker shades) appear to have higher prices, though they are fewer in number.
    
2. HOUSE :-
    * This plot also represent the same relationship, but with higher price ranges reaching up to 30 million.
    * Larger built-up areas and properties with more bedrooms dominate the higher price segment.
    
3. COMMON FOUNDINGS : -
    1. Built-up Area vs Price Relationship: The price of properties generally increases with an increase in 
                                            built-up area. This is evident from the upward trend in the scatterplots.
    2. Bedroom Count: Properties with a higher number of bedrooms (indicated by darker color shades) tend 
                      to have higher prices.
    3. Concentration: Most properties are clustered in the lower price range with smaller built-up areas
                      (less than 4,000 sq ft specially for flats).

1. Price Range by Bedroom Count:
   - 1 BHK: The price range is relatively narrow, with most properties priced lower. Few outliers exist in the higher
            price range.
   - 2 BHK: Prices start to vary more, showing a moderate range with a few outliers.
   - 3 BHK: The price range widens significantly, indicating higher variance. Some properties are priced much higher
            than the majority.
   - 4 BHK: The widest range of prices is observed here. This category has the highest median price and several
            outliers in the premium range.

2. Price Trends:
   - As the number of bedrooms increases, the median price generally rises.
   - Properties with more bedrooms (3 BHK and 4 BHK) show greater variability, reflecting higher demand and 
     luxury pricing.

3. Outliers:
   - There are extreme price points in all categories, particularly in the 4 BHK segment, which could represent 
     luxury or premium properties.
   - The lower BHK categories have fewer high-value outliers, indicating budget housing.

4. Utility:
   - This chart helps identify the typical price range for properties with varying bedroom counts, which can 
     assist buyers and sellers in decision-making.

1. Price Range and Density:
    Flats (orange line): Most flats are priced lower, concentrated within a narrow range. The high peak indicates
                         that the majority of flat prices are similar, likely clustered around the median.
                         
    Houses (blue line):  The price distribution for houses is more spread out, with a broader curve, indicating higher
                         price variability.

2. Overlapping Region:
    The overlapping region near the peak suggests that there are some price ranges where houses and flats are priced 
    similarly.

3. Outliers:
    Houses extend to much higher prices compared to flats, indicating the presence of luxury or premium houses in
    the dataset.

4. Implication:
    Flats tend to be more affordable and uniform in pricing, whereas houses are more expensive and show greater 
    variation.
